## About Me

Hello there! I'm Emre, a sophomore second-year Computer Science student and a member of a Rover Team at the Planetary Robotics Lab. We are all about developing Mars rovers, and I specialize in the Computer Science division. 🖥️ 🌌

When I'm not contemplating the mysteries of outer space, you can find me assisting in the realm of numbers as a Mathematics Teaching Assistant at my university. 📚🧮

Outside the lab and classroom, my personal interests take flight in game development and web design, where I channel my creativity into crafting engaging experiences and interactive solutions. 🎮🌐
